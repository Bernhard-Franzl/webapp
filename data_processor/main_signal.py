# TODO:
# - during the calculation of participants construct a signal that shows the participants over time
# we need that for nice viszalization

# - make a filter that checks for unplausible signal:
# E.g: if one person enters and one leaves after 1 second in the same door 
# -> change direction if necessary, maybe in form of a sliding window

# - make viszalization interactive (plotly)

# - incorporate measures from the manual control data
# -> Especially inspect the signals of event type 5 followd by 6 
# -> could be a person entering that is cut of in the middle of the signal

# DONE:
# - from signal calculate something like: "participants" 
# We need one number representing the participants of course(defined time span)
# Good parameter for m: 3
